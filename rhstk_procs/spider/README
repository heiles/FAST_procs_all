07FEB2012: 

problems from furea in running spider. reason was that there 81 insteaad
of 80 poins in the spider legs. i generalized the software to fix this.

more seriously, the cal amplitudes were twice what they should have been
in cross3_gbtcal.pro; the numbers were divided by half the integration
time instead of the integration time itself (the accumulated numbers are
proportional to the integ time). fixed this and annotated the program.

gathered all the spider software together, ut it in the
rhstk/procs/spider subdir, and went through to eliminate duplicate
versions of procedures.
