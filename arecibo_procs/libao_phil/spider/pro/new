;
; changes to be made for parameters N routines
; 1. number channels is variables
; 2. cal run with 2 a,b rather than i,q,u,v
; 3. should run with number of strips 2 or 4 .. this comes later..??
;
; compromise..
;  If not specified, use nchannels of first spectra we find 
; for all of the spectra.
; Allow user to pass in number of channels..
;
;- hdrMueller_carl.h - needs to be changed to a routine??
;   
;  scndata must become an array so we can have different config
;  in 
;
so far
07dec04: the was version will work if you just took total power rather than
;        stokes. ends up filling in the I,Q fits.. and not the u,v
;		 except there is not phase correction for q
;
;29dec04: updated mmtostr.pro, hdrMueller.h,mmproc, etc..
		  the {mueller} structure is now the combination of old and
		  new. got rid of mueller_carl..
