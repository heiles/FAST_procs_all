50/430 Mhz ran with ryans machine using olmost continous mode.
to see if meteors emmited any rf (no transmitter used)
2 mhz bw. used 10ms ipp but took less that 16K samples

metspcimg.pro.dev
break each ipp into N lenfft .. compute fft 
;                            .. then make dynamic spectra

;
; computer tp each point then make waterfall plot
; with total power wrapping right edge to left on next row up.
