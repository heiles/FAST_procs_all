computing laser ranging offset from ao9 center

8mar00 - computes pitch, roll from dx,dy..
	   - tried removing tspitch,roll 1 az term from dx,dy
		 pitch,roll to make it independant of the current 1az term
		 of the platform. 
		  - much for scatter in fits vs za
		  - made 1az amplitudes for pitch, roll diverge.
		 default processing leaves it out (it can be put back in by
		 	uncommenting out 2 lines in ts08mar00

		 -->correction values put in pro: tsdxdycor

		 todo - need to compute the offset lr, ao9 and remove that 
				and then reprocess above equation.

1az terms....
-------------------
31jan00- theodolite
	no good lr data for this since they didn't wait at least 2 minutes
	at each spot to get a good lr reading.
	used az angles as reported by lynn, made first point match 
	encoder value..
	theod data
		- azswth,azfitth   - raw data,fits
		- azswthc,azfitthc - remove tilt sensor 1az term. This makes the
							 data "better" since the pith,roll phase
							 angle for 1 az come closer to 180 degrees
		 1az Amp   phase

tsP	  	  .0018    linear ramp 50-300 vs za
txR	      .0046    193.2  well defined

dxdyP	  .0167    111
dxdyR	  .0166    201

dxdyPc	  .0172    111.9 removed ts 1az term
dxdyRc	  .0126    200.6

going --> dx,dy .. use pitch:
	phase ange --> where pitch is zer
	maxPitch   --> phase angle + 90 degrees
	dr motion  --> - 180 degrees since moving away from center-->
				   current pitch too small.

theod from 31jan00: use corrected..
	r=.0254*pi/180*435*12 = 2.3 inches  cor
	angle= 188 degrees max pitch --> dr direction +8 degrees az
	nocor
	r=.0238*pi/180*435*12 = 2.15 inches  no cor
	angle= 181 degrees max pitch --> dr direction +1 degrees az

lr from 8mar00: use uncorrected
	r=.0167*pi/180*435*12 = 1.52 inches 
	angle= 111 + 90-180 = 11 degrees

assume theod angle true north (from encoder and model corr < 1 arc minute)
assume lr 0 angle also true north..(probably not valid)

dx=r*sin(th)    (theta measured from north, x+ ->east)
dy=r*cos(th)

dxTh=.32 inches
dyTh=2.27
dxLr=.29
dyLr=1.49

use theod (a09) coord center. x1,y1 offset of platform
let x1',x2' be offset measured by lr, and x0Lr,y0Lr be lr center in ao9 coord
x1=x1'  + x0Lr
y1=y1'  + y0Lr
-------------------------------------
 offset lr in ao9 coord system
x0Lr = x1 - x1'   = .32 - .29   = .03 inches (east  + )
y0Lr = y1 - y1'   = 2.27 - 1.49 = .78 inches (north + )
