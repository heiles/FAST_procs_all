file: ~phil/idl/ReadmeExport
For exporting correlator/ri idl routines.. some of the things you need to do.
----------------------------------------------------------- 
Making the tar file to take with you:
    You can creat a tar file on disc and then ftp it to your site..
The file size is < 1mb:
	The tar file already exists at:
	~phil/idl/idl.tar. it is about 800 kb

    You can then ftp this file to your home computer.

----------------------------------------------------------- 
Installing the routines at your home institution.

    Create a directory to place the ao idl routines and a second directory 
	to hold the html documentation (that is accessible from a web 
	browser)  Lets assume you used: 
	- /share/idl/ao to store the idl procedures.
	- /home/aoidl/public_html for the directory to hold the idl html
							  documentation
	- http://www.yoursite.edu/~aoidl as the url for the directory
							  in step 2 (change the address to the 
							  correct value).


    cp idl.tar to /share/idl/ao
    tar -xf idl.tar

    If you run tar as root, be sure and include the o option (-xof) so that
    the owner of the files is the person running tar.


0. in the user's  startup file for idl add:
   !path = expand_path('+/share/idl/ao/gen')+':'+ !path

1. in /share/idl/ao/gen/aodefdir.pro
    change:     return,'/pkg/rsi/local/libao/phil/'
        to:     return,'/share/idl/ao/'
    change:     return,'/home/phil/pubilc_html/'
        to:     return,'/home/aoidl/pubilc_html/'
    change:     return,'http://www.naic.edu/~phil/'
        to:     return,'http://www.yoursite.edu/~aoidl/'

--> warning.. make sure the above paths include the trailing '/'
              eg '/pkg/rsi/local/libao/phil/'   ... correct
                 '/pkg/rsi/local/libao/phil'    ... wrong

2. After you have created the html directory you can run
   @allmkdoc  

   This will create a file /tmp/idlmkall.pro and execute it. It will
   create the various html files in the aodefdir(/doc) directory.
   It deletes the /tmp/aomkall.pro file when it is done.

3. When you go to run idl, it is easiest to use a startup file
   that idl executes when it is started. You can include 
   all the paths that tell idl where you have stored the aoidl directories.
   an example would be:

   suppose you want to call your idl startup file: ~yourHomedir/startup.idl 
   (yourHomeDir should be replaced with whatever your home directory is..)

   It could include lines like:

   ;  lines starting with ; are comments
   ;  edit_input tells idl how many lines to remember when using the
   ;  up arrow to recall/edit previous commands
   ;
   !EDIT_INPUT=500
   ;
   ;  the next lines tells idl where to find the aodefdir routine
   ;  that is then used to define all of the paths...
   ;
   !path = expand_path('+/share/idl/ao/gen')+':'+ !path
   ;
   ;  This is just some extra junk i use for plotting
   ;
   !x.style=1
   !y.style=1
  
  You then set the environment variable IDL_STARTUP to point to this file (
  stick it in your shell startup script). 
  
  A csh example is 


  In .cshrc put
  
  setenv IDL_STARTUP  ~yourHomedir/startup.idl
;
;
	Then you would just:


	idl
	@corinit		.. if you are using the interim correlator
	@wasinit2       .. if you are using the  wappp spectral line data.
	etc...
