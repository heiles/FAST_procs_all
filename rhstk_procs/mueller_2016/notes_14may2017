fitting the mueller matrix using a single source:
	mmfit_2016.promem 
this now allows a nonzero Stokes V. Given the mueller matrix params, it
calclaes the response using
	guess_tot_st.pro
	tdata_guess_.pro
The 'multiple sources' versions of above are
	mmfit_2016_multiplesources.pro*
	guess_tot_st_multiplesources.pro
	tdata_guess_multiplesources.pro
the stimulus for this 'multiplesources'	was deriving the matrix coeffs
and also the source pol properties using OH masers, specifically
W49. For e.g. of usage, see

and in particular, the software test file which generates a known
paralllactic angle dependence of observed source params and solves for
them:
