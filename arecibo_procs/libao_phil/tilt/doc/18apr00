start 130200 (46920). az=0, za=10 (requested) .1 deg/sec.
	actual position was 96.3228,9.9795

compute what should have been from idl and compare it with what was
measured.

start 142200  az spin az=0,za=10 .2 deg/sec dome actually stationary

start 150700  az spin az=0 za=4  .2 deg/sec


start 154200 az spin az=0,za=16 .2deg/sec
		till az 15.. td 4 had gone into the down limit. 
			check that the zero velocity is not creeping.
		
	1. needed to recompile tieProg.. had old limits.
	2. tdChkLim needs to be fixed... isn't working if you hit the
	   maxLim on 1 td an min limit on the other...

start 16:16:00   az=0,za=360, .2 deg/sec ..
		reloaded tieProg recompiling with new limits..
