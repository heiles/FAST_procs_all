 NAME:
       INDX2DIM

 PURPOSE:
       Converts one-dimensional indices into multidimensional indices.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       Result = INDX2DIM(Array, Index_Array, [, 
       N_DIMENSIONS=variable][, DIMENSIONS=variable] )

 INPUTS:
       ARRAY: a multidimensional array 
       INDEX_ARRAY: array of one-dimensional indices in ARRAY

 OUTPUTS:
       Returns an N_DIMENSIONS by N_elements(index_array) array with
       the multidimensional array indices corresponding to each 
       one-dimensional array index stored in index_array.  If any of
       the input one-dimensional indices are greater than the number
       of total elements in the input array (or less than zero) then
       the multidimensional index returned for each such out-of-range
       index will be a row of -1L.

 OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
       N_DIMENSIONS = the number of dimensions of ARRAY
       DIMENSIONS = the dimensions of ARRAY; a vector of length N_DIMENSIONS

 COMMON BLOCKS:
       None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       None.

 EXAMPLE:
       Make a 4-D array...
       IDL> x = indgen(2,3,4,5)

       Use WHERE to get the 1-D indices for where array is multiple
       of 25...
       IDL> indx = where(x mod 25 eq 0, nindx)

       Return the multidimensional array indices 
       IDL> dim = indx2dim(x,indx,N_DIMENSIONS=ndim,DIMENSIONS=dims)

       Check the dimensions of the array x...
       IDL> print, dims
                  2           3           4           5

       Check the size of the returned multidimensional array; it should
       be N_DIMENSIONS by N_elements(indx)...
       IDL> help, ndim, nindx, dim
       NDIM            LONG      =            4
       NINDX           LONG      =            5
       DIM             LONG      = Array[4, 5]

       Finally, what are the multidimensional indices...
       IDL> print, dim
                  0           0           0           0
                  1           0           0           1
                  0           1           0           2
                  1           1           0           3
                  0           2           0           4

 NOTES:
       This routine now exists in IDL 6.0 and is named
       ARRAY_INDICES(). However, if you pass in an index that is out
       of bounds, ARRAY_INDICES() crashes and gives a warning.

       The returned array has size N_DIMENSIONS by N_elements(index_array).
       This is because the user will most likely be using a loop to access
       each of the returned multidimensional indices: it is faster to loop
       over the second dimension of the returned 2-D array. E.g., in the
       above example, you would access each of the multidimensional
       indices like this...

       IDL> for i = 0, nindx-1 do print, dim[*,i]

       We are accessing each row, which is faster than accessing each
       column, hence my choice for the orientation of the returned array.
