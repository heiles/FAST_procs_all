CLOUDS.PRO

generates all possible orderings of clouds along the los.


GFITFLEX_EXP.PRO:

gfitflex_exp_num.pro and gfitflex_exp.pro are idenical except one uses
numericcal derivatives.

gfitflex_exp_wgt.pro and gfitflex_exp.pro are idenical except wgt version
allows weights.

gfitflex_exp.pro fits exp(-sum of Gaussians). parameters of the gaussians
are hgt, cen, wid. 

TB_EXP.PRO calculates the emission from clouds in arbitrry ordeer,
including both CNM and zero-opacity WNM.

WNMFIT_EXP calculates tspin for WNM, using residuals from a CNM fit. 

TBGFITFLEX_EXP fits multiple emission/abs components.
