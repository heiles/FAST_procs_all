;NAME:
;ZFIT -- Fit B fields to Stokes V and I/2 data
;
;PURPOSE:
;    Fit B fields to Stokes V and I/2 data in the channel range
;         chnl1a to chnl2a. Fits the V spectrum to the derivative
;         of the I/2 spectrum (providing the field) and, also, to
;         the I/2 spectrum itself (providing the 'gain' error).

;       vpredicted, vmodified, a
;
;INPUTS:
;     v0: the data points of the Stokes V spectrum.
;     i0: the data points of the Stokes I/2 (***NOT Stokes I***) spectrum.
;     chnl1a: the first channel nr to include in the fit.
;     chnl2a: the last channel nr to include in the fit.
;
;OUTPUTS:
;     bfld: the fitted magnetic field. UNITS ARE CHANNELS; SEE BELOW
;     berr: the uncertainty in the fitted field.
;     gain: the 'gain error', the fraction of residual I/2 leaked into V.
;     gainerr: the uncertainty in the gain error.
;     vpredicted: the V spectrum predicted from the bfld (all channels)
;     vmodified: measured V spectrum with the 'gain error' removed.
;     a: the array of solved-for coefficients
;
;UNITS OF FITTED FIELD:
;       Bfld is the frequency separation betweeen the RHC and LHC
;components in units of channels. Thus, if the channel width is 2800 Hz
;and bfld is returned as 1.00, and if the splitting is 2.8 Hz per microG
;as it is for HI, then the freq separation between the two components is
;2800 Hz and the field is 1000 Microg.
;
;RESTRICTIONS:
;    None...that we know of.
;EXAMPLE:
;    You have measured a V and an I spectrum and you want to
;         derive the associated field strength.
